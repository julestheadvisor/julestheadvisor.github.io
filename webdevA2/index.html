                <p class="odd">
                    Bandai first obtained the rights to produce models based on the Gundam 
                    franchise, and created the first Gunpla model, meant to be assembled by the buyer. 
                    This first Gunpla iteration, unlike later models, also required glue to assemble and cost about 
                    300 yen or roughly 3 dollars. Retrospectively, they are called First Grade (FG) kits.

                    Snap-fit models were introduced in the model line for Gundam Sentinel; these models 
                    needed little to no glue to assemble and later became the norm in 1988.

                <p class="odd">
                    Bandai introduced the High Grade (HG) line of model kits, which marked the creation of 
                    a grade system to describe the detail and complexity of each kit at a glance. Despite 
                    being kits made in a 1:144 scale, HG kits featured much better details and articulation 
                    for its time.

                    extensive detailing and articulation out of all main grades, and an inner skeletal frame. 
                    This skeletal frame would also later be used in a few lower grade kits, sometimes only

                    As a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Gundam franchise, Bandai re-released 
                    kits of mobile suits from the original series. These kits were marketed as 
                    budget models, and featured the simplicity of the original kits but with modern designs 
                    referenced from their corresponding PG kits.

                <p class="odd">
                    A new type of non-graded (NG) model kits were introduced for the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED 
                    models. NG kits featured a different design plan altogether, which omitted major joints 
                    and only allowed certain crucial pieces to move, and were budget models that retailed at 
                    lower prices.

                    RX-78-2 Gundam was released. This kit had many features that made it easier to assemble 
                    for people new to the hobby. 
                    <br>
                    In the same year, Bandai also released the Real Grade (RG) line, which took elements such 
                    as the skeletal frame from MG kits and combined them with the 1:144 scale, and Ecopla, a 
                    line of kits made entirely of recycled sprues and molded in black color.

                    Unlike other lines, the first line of EG kits were made in China and initially discontinued 
                    until its rebooting in 2020 with kits from non-Gundam franchises. 
                    <br>
                    In the same year, the Advanced Grade (AG) line was also introduced. Similar to the EG, FG 
                    and NG lines, AG was also a budget line and focused more on the arrangement of colored 
                    parts, sacrificing articulation.

                <h3>Items and Things needed</h3>
                <p>
                    Let us start from the very basics, with a model kit of whatever has caught your eye 
                    (preferably a HG for a beginner or even an EG, if you could find one to your liking) 
                    and a basic, cheap pair of nippers. Optionally, you can also have sandpapers of various 
                    grit to sand down nubs after cutting, but this is slowly falling out of trend in favour 
                    of glass files, which are much more durable and easy to clean, and don't leave scratch 
                    marks and blemishes as easily.

                    Getting a pen for panel lining (generally advised for newbies to get soft tip pens, as 
                    they are easier to use and do not require as much cleanup) is also an option to provide 
                    more contrast to the model, along with tweezers for easy picking up and adjustment of 
                    stickers and decals.

                    As one builds more and gains more experience, you may decide to get things like acrylic 
                    paints for further customisation via painting, or a chisel for scribing extra panel lines 
                    and making existing panel lines more clear and detailed. Getting a stand to put runners on 
                    to facilitate looking for the right one to cut the part from is also a good choice.

                    Plastic cement is always also a good thing to have, and can help in covering up mistakes 
                    and filling up seam lines for a connected look between certain parts. Clear top coat 
                    (whether matte or gloss is up to personal preference) is also good to have to provide 
                    any stickers, paint and decals with protection from the elemnts after assembly, especially 
                    if the model is not going to be displayed in a dedicated plastic case.
                </p>
                <h3>Where to start from</h3>
                <p>
                    Simply open the box, and first remove the instructions manual. Personally, I would then 
                    free all the runners from the plastic wrapping to allow easy access later on. From that 
                    point onwards, most of the building process will be following the manual. 

                    The average HG build at base can take about 4 hours. However, with the addition of 
                    customisation, this can be bumped up to multiple days, even weeks and months depending 
                    on the amount of detail added. Personally, my process for building parts is some variation 
                    of Cutting -> Sanding -> Scribing -> Panel Lining -> Priming -> Painting -> Top Coating. 
                    If this looks intimidating, don't worry; starting out, it is only recommended to do cutting, 
                    sanding and panel lining to avoid overwhelming yourself. As a matter of fact, the rest of 
                    the process can actually be tacked on in a future date once you are more comfortable with 
                    building, so don't worry about leaving things incomplete for now.

                    Of course, this process also differs from part to part, especially if the part is going to be 
                    attached to another part down the line thus meaning I can top coat both parts together if 
                    it wouldn't lead to clotting of the top coat in some corner.
                </p>
                <h3>Decoration Tips</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that you've built some parts of your Gunpla model and perhaps even assembled these parts 
                    together to form a complete model, it's time to decorate. Assuming that stickers have already 
                    been placed onto the model in corresponding steps where it is mentioned, what is left is 
                    decals. Most HG kits will not have these, but RG, MG and PG will always have a bunch of them. 
                    
                    First off, there are two types of decals--dry transfer and waterslides. Dry transfers can 
                    simply be transferred onto the plastic by using pressure to stick the decal onto the model. 
                    However, waterslides require the decal to be soaked in water for a few seconds before it 
                    can be transferred onto the model. Both types of decoration will involve cutting out the 
                    decal in question around its edges leaving a bit of empty space to facilitate transfer. 

                    For dry transfer, basic instructions will be stated on the manual, but a tip from me is to use 
                    cotton buds to apply pressure as it is generally more even and slightly softer than using your 
                    fingers, thus reducing the risk of accidentally damaging the plastic in the process. 

                    For waterslides, also use a cotton bud (DO NOT use your finger as the decal is generally very 
                    fragile and breaks easily, especially if over-soaked) to move the waterslide onto the plastic. 
                    Following that, simply let it dry and it will stay there. An advantage of waterslides is that 
                    if you are dissatisfied with how it came out, you can simply add a drop or two of water to move 
                    it around again. 

                    If applying decals, it is also highly recommended to apply a bottom gloss coat as priming, 
                    even more so if painting has been done beforehand as there is a risk that the decoration won't 
                    adhere well to paint, or adhere too well and be unable to be adjusted in the case of waterslides. 
                    Also apply a top coat of your choice after, so that the decorations don't get dusty and there is 
                    less chance of them degrading due to the environment. It also makes the model easier to clean, by 
                    making it so that running it under water will not wash off any decoration, paint or ink.

                <p>
                    Majorly, there are two kinds of communities surrounding this hobby: offline and online.

                    Offline communities are relatively harder to find especially if you aren't located in the 
                    United States or Japan, where there is higher congregation of hobbyists. However, a surefire 
                    way to fine like-minded people is to attend events surrounding the hobby, such as Tetsujin 
                    in Singapore, last held in June. Anime conventions in general can see large amounts of 
                    hobbyists attending, especially if there are also booths retailing model kits. 

                    Online, main avenues of community lie in the form of Discord, Twitter and Reddit, where 
                    hobbyists from around the world are able to share their builds and tips regardless of 
                    timezone and location, allowing communication across the globe. It is much easier to find 
                    Gunpla hobbyists on than offline for this reason, due to the wide but somewhat sparse spread 
                    of builders around the world.
